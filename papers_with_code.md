# Papers with Code

For each of my first-authored papers since 2024 I create a "papers with code" Markdown website.

Each website contains literate code explaining all the steps required to reproduce my results and figures. 

These research products are a manifestation of my commitment to openness and reproducibility in science. 

Using iNaturalist to understand trait and climate drivers of daily activity patterns in temperate butterflies (2024) (in prep)

Interactions between sexual signaling and wing size drive ecology and evolution of wing colors in Odonata (2024) (published, website almost ready)
