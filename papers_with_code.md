# Papers with Code

For each of my first-authored papers since 2024 I create a "papers with code" Markdown website.

Each website contains literate code explaining all the steps required to reproduce my results and figures. 

These research products are a manifestation of my commitment to openness and reproducibility in science. 

[dragonfly-color-macro-analysis](https://jidec.github.io/dragonfly-color-macro-analysis/): Assessing global dragonfly body color diversity using species-constrastive features from iNaturalist images (2024 in prep, website in prep)

[inat-butterfly-activity-analysis](https://jidec.github.io/inat-butterfly-activity-analysis/): Using iNaturalist to understand trait and climate drivers of daily activity patterns in temperate butterflies (2024 in prep, website in prep)

[nearctic-odonate-wings-analysis](https://jidec.github.io/nearctic-odonate-wings-analysis/): Interactions between sexual signaling and wing size drive ecology and evolution of wing colors in Odonata (2024)
