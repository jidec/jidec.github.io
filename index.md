# About

I am a PhD candidate at the Florida Museum of Natural History at the University of Florida as part of the Guralnick Lab. I work on eco-evolutionary modeling of traits, AI and computer-vision-based data collection, and educational game dev.

This site includes my publications, "papers with code" websites, software packages, and more. 

Feel free to contact me at jacob.idec [at] ufl [dot] edu.
